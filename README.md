# Phala Style Guild

## Code Style

- For new projects, choose a consistent code style and adhere to it.
- For existing projects, follow the existing code style.
- If the project includes third-party code, leave their code style unchanged.
- Document code that has complex logic or uses advanced language features.
- Always use linters and formatters to check your code before making commits.

## Code Review

- Before requesting a code review, ensure that all CI checks have passed.
- Use a consistent style for git commit messages.
- Set time limits for PRs and reviews.

## Communication:

- Use correct English in all written communication, including code comments, git commit messages, and documents. Use tools to help ensure that your intentions are clearly conveyed.
